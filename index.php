        <h4>Hello and welcome!</h4>
        <p>This is a simple personal showcase, a classic static, not-frameworked (yet!) portfolio webpage.<br>
          You may meet me at the <a href="about.php"><em>About</em></a> section for personal and professional details. There is a brief profile 
          and bio explaning who I am, what I do, and how I got here with some links to my online profiles and reference depos. 
          You can also check my academic career at the <a href="education.html"><em>Education</em></a>, where there is a summary of the fields I have devoted my professional 
          and personal interests through the years.
          Alternatively, you may jump to a probably more interesting section, where you can find samples of 
          each of my current activity niches: Spatial Data Analysis and traditional GIS. <br>
          Please, feel free to look around, and get in touch if any of it catches your eye.   
          <strong><h5>Thanks for visiting, and best wishes!</h5></strong>
